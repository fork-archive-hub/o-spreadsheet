What we don't support at parsing of the XML : 
	- style : 
		- fills : gradients
		- fonts : 
			- font family : kind of useless for us. It's an index to the table at OpenXml §18.18.94
		- cellStyleXfs : 
			- From my testing, this doesn't seems to be taken into account by excel/calc
		- boolean applyAlignment/applyFont/applyFill... :
			- From my testing, this doesn't seems to be taken into account by excel/calc
		- row/col style

	- strings : 
		- richText (text with non-uniform formatting)
			- we only extract the text, and not the formatting

	- conditionalFormat : 
		- cf type : dataBar

	- figures : 
		- figures that have an anchor different than twoCellAnchor (but I couldn't find when a different anchor type was used in Excel)
		- figures that don't contain a chart (eg. Images)

	- charts : 
		- everything not pie/doughnut/bar/line chart

	- pivot :
		- we don't support excel-like pivot. Import them as Table (values + not-too-ugly styling)

What we don't support at conversion (!NW = no warning generated for these): 
	- Borders :
		- most border styles
		- diagonal borders
	- Align :
		- some horizontal alignments
		- vertical alignement
		- other align options (wrapText, indent, shrinkToFit, ...) (!NW)
	- Fills :
		- only support solid fill pattern
	- Font :
		- only support Arial
	- Conditional Formats:
		- Types : 
			- AboveAverage
			- (Not)Contains Error
			- Data Bar (not supported at parsing)
			- Duplicated/uniques values
			- TimePeriod
			- Top10
		- Formats : 
			- Border
			- Num format
		- IconSets : 
			- We don't support most of the icons, replace them with some we support (!NW)
			- We don't support empty icons in IconSet (It makes the cf side panel crash!) 
			- We don't support IconSet with more than 3 icons, replace them with Iconset with 3 icons (!NW)
	- Charts : 
		- convert pie chart into doughnut chart (!NW)
	- Tables (!NW) :
		- we don't support tables the same way as Excel, the most we can do is import cells with formatting to represent a table
		- table style in XLSX is a string that represent a stlye... and there's 80+ different styles supported. Yep. We'll just slap a style
			not too ugly to the table and call it a day.


What they do we don't : 
	- normalize formulas at export, basically if a formula can be autofilled from another, they don't export it
