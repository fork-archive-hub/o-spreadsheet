1. join row/col commands in one
2. change merge to take a target of a single zone
3. change conditional format to take a target instead of ranges
4. create interface for core commands
	sheet = prop sheet id UID
    position= col & row number + sheet id
    dimension= COL | ROW + sheet id
    target= zone [] + sheet Id
    objectId'y = objectId (not sheetId or any existing ID, for CF and figure) + sheet id
